Example using Google App Engine

This is not using any framework wrapper (e.g. django-assets, flask-assets),
but just shows the bare minimum approach.

To run the sample, use:

    $ ./appengine-sdk/dev_appserver.py examples/appengine

Remember, you need to build your assets manually:

    $ examples/appengine/assets.py
