Asset management application for Python web development - use it to
merge and compress your JavaScript and CSS files.

        Since releases aren't exactly happening on a regular schedule, you are
        encouraged to use the latest code. ``webassets`` is pretty well tested,
        so as long as the build status icon above remains a reassuring green,
        you shouldn't run into any trouble.

        You can `download a tarball`__ of the development version, or
        install it via ``pip install webassets==dev``.
